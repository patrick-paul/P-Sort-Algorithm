# P-Sort-Algorithm
Brief intro Of The Algo

P-Sort Algorithm is an inefficient sorting algorithm derived from the
idea of Binary Search Technique... It's works very fine and I welcome
Any One For Code Review on it! 

Detailed Intro Of The Algo

  This algorithim Works By sorting an arrays of any length with random,
  non-repeating whole numbers in a linear manner by ascending order 
  basing On Your Computer's Computing Speed.
  This algorithim is designed and developed by Patrick Paul, under the
  inspiration of Binary Search Algorithim.
  
  Depending On Your Computer's Computing Power, This Algorithim Can Sort 
  Numbers To Unlimited Level!!!
